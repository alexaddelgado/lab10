To begin, I followed this tutorial to set up Angular so I could use it while in VScode:
`),t(8,"a",0),e(9,"Click here"),n(),i(10,"br")(11,"br"),e(12,`
1. I opened a terminal in VScode and ran the following commands:
`),n(),t(13,"p",1),e(14,"Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned "),i(15,"br"),e(16,'npm install -g "@"angular/cli '),n(),t(17,"p"),e(18,`
2. I entered the command into the terminal to start a new workspace:
`),n(),t(19,"p",1),e(20,"ng new my-app"),n(),t(21,"p"),e(22,`
3. I moved on to the next tutorial on how to edit the new web page I had created: `),t(23,"a",2),e(24,"Click here"),n(),i(25,"br")(26,"br"),e(27,`
4. I opened the new workspace folder I had created in step 2 to start editing the HTML
and CSS files.`),i(28,"br")(29,"br"),e(30,`
5. To run the website locally and see the changes in real time, I ran the following command in the VSCode terminal:
`),n(),t(31,"p",1),e(32,"ng serve --open"),n(),i(33,"h4"),t(34,"h3"),e(35,"Final Thoughts"),n(),i(36,"h4"),t(37,"p"),e(38," Choosing to use angular was a really easy transition because it required knowledge about HTML and CSS. Although it required Typescript, this was not too much of an impediment as I used the Angular website's tutorial which provided skeleton code to help me create a simple web page. I also like any changes I make updates live rather than having to load the page every time I save my file. "),i(39,"br")(40,"br"),e(41," For the most part, I did not experience any difficulties as the Angular website had very thorough tutorials. "),i(42,"br")(43,"br"),e(44,` I've heard of plenty people using Angular for web development but never got around to trying it. However, after this lab I can definitely see myself using it again in the near future.
